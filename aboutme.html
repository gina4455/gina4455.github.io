    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Gina, I am a Computer Science BS Major, I am a returning student and already have a degree in Marine Affairs BS. I plan on getting into cyber security and networking, computer science will help build the foundation of computers that will help as I learn about more in depth topics.<br>

I am a serving member in the RI Air National Guard as a 1D751R or Radio Frequency Transmission System Technician, which is really long for "I work on anything that can give off a radio signal and its related software" and a veteran. I currently work for the Navy as a contractor. My military career is what pushed me to return to school and pursue the another degree in computer science.<br>
